# Jacopo Ferrazza

Howdie there, I'm a software engineer based in the Dominican Republic with a passion for quality assurance and automation.  My passion for technology came at an early age, since the majority of my childhood was spent around computers.  Later on as a teen, I discovered my passion for software by coding my first “Hello World” in QBasic.


## About me 👨🏻‍💻

Italian born and Dominican raised. A true foodie at heart, with a thing for 🍕.<br/> You can always find me reading on my spare time, with some of my best-loved literary works by author Valerio Massimo Manfredi. Notwithstanding an interest in every genre, historically based novels are my preference.  Alan Watts is a must for my everyday thinking.<br/><br/> A stoic at heart, but with a practical mind. Always curious and open to other philosophies and ways of life. 


## Work life 💻

Towards the beginning of my career, I worked with different clients and distinct technologies to secure quality throughout the software development life cycle of web applications. With an interest in mobile technologies, I’ve recently switched to work on assuring the quality, testing and automating mobile applications, thus helping teams achieved CI/CD.
