# Jacopo Ferrazza

Hey, I'm Jacopo Ferrazza, a software engineer based in the Dominican Republic with a passion for quality assurance and automation.  My passion for technology came at an early age, since the majority of my childhood was spent around computers.  Later on as a teen, I discovered my passion for software by coding my first “Hello World” in QBasic.


## About me

Italian born and Dominican raised. A true foodie at heart, with a thing for 🍕.<br/> You can always find me reading on my spare time, with some of my best-loved literary works by author Valerio Massimo Manfredi. Notwithstanding an interest in every genre, historically based novels are my preference.  Alan Watts is a must for my everyday thinking.<br/><br/> A stoic at heart, but with a practical mind. Always curious and open to other philosophies and ways of life. 

## Work life 
Towards the beginning of my career, I worked with different clients and distinct technologies to secure quality throughout the process, requirements and interfaces of web systems. With an interest in mobile technologies, I’ve recently worked in the testing, reporting and automating mobile applications. Want to know I’ve been up to lately?
